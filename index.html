                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p> Talon is comprised of a variety of individuals, each with their own goals and ideals. Through de facto leader Doomfist, the current manifesto is that humanity is made stronger through conflict. Consequently, Talon seeks to sow turmoil across the globe to strengthen the human race. Repeatedly, Talon has demonstrated disregard for the standard rules of engagement, attacking both military and civilian targets with impunity</p>
                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>Talon was operating as early as the years following the end of the Omnic Crisis. In the time since, they have steadily grown more bold and powerful. Members of Talon are clad in black body armor, complete with helmets and face-obscuring ballistic masks. However, these soldiers appear to be mere rank-and-file grunts; Talon commands enough technological and scientific talent to create and field far more lethal operatives, such as Widowmaker.</p>
